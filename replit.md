## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, using Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for state management.
- **UI/UX**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, featuring an Odoo-inspired design with sidebar navigation, card-based layouts, muted purple accents, glassmorphism effects, and responsive design.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript, ESM modules).
- **API Style**: RESTful API.
- **Database Interaction**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Key Features**:
    - Server-side PDF generation.
    - Robust authentication with role-based access control.
    - Comprehensive CSV upload/synchronization.
    - AI Chatbot: Hybrid RAG system using OpenAI GPT-4o with local BM25 fallback.
    - CRM: Comprehensive customer journey tracking, reorder intelligence, "Next Best Move" coaching, and customer machine profile management (tracks which machine types each customer owns at `/odoo-contacts/:id`).
    - Email Studio & Drip Campaigns: Automated multi-step email sequences with engagement tracking.
    - Odoo V19 Enterprise Integration: JSON-RPC API client for bidirectional data access (customers, products, pricelists, sale orders, users) and a guided product creation wizard. The `/odoo-contacts` page is the primary customer management interface, defaulting to company card view. `/odoo-products` displays products from Odoo with detailed pricing and inventory. App users are mapped to Odoo counterparts via email.
    - Shopify Integration: Embedded Shopify Admin app with OAuth, webhook registration, and order/customer sync.
    - Admin Rules & Config System: Admin-only area for adjusting coaching logic, product taxonomy, and an audit log.
    - SPOTLIGHT (Coaching Treadmill): Daily task management system for prioritized client actions. Data sync architecture prioritizes a local CRM database as the source of truth, queuing changes for weekly Odoo sync. **UI Redesign (Jan 2026)**: New "Pastel & Soft" three-column layout designed for professionals aged 30-50 to reduce eye strain. Left sidebar (w-72) with progress ring SVG, efficiency score, streak counter, and bucket progress bars. Center column with task cards. Right sidebar (w-64) with collapsible coaching trays (Calling Script Ideas, Email Ideas). Uses cream background (#FDFBF7), glassmorphism effects, and soft pastel accent colors.
    - Bulk Editing: Supports bulk editing of Tags, Sales Rep, and Payment Terms for multiple selected Odoo contacts.
    - Reports Page (Admin Only): Financial metrics dashboard at `/reports` displaying Total Invoices, Inventory Turnover, Gross Profit, and Debt to Equity Ratio.
    - Auto Sales Rep Assignment: Logic to automatically assign sales representatives based on customer location.
- **Email as Key Identifier**: Email is the primary identifier across all systems (Odoo, Shopify, Gmail, local CRM), utilizing an email normalization system for consistent matching and data integrity.
- **Business Metrics Calculation**:
    - Average Margin: Calculated from Odoo's `sale.order` `margin_percent` field.
    - Pricing Tier: For non-Odoo customers, pricing tiers can be assigned locally.
    - Best Price Engine: Calculates optimal price recommendations combining margin protection, loyalty rewards, inventory velocity, volume discounts, and competitor intelligence, with a cost fallback chain and confidence scoring.

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit.
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless connection.
- **Schema**: Defined in `/shared/schema.ts`.
- **System Design**: Comprehensive foreign key constraints, unified `productPricingMaster` table, and performance optimizations including database indexes, lazy-loading, server-side pagination, and `pg_trgm` for search.
