## Key Concepts for New Developers

### 1. Odoo V19 Integration
- Syncs customers, products, pricelists, and orders
- **Important**: Odoo V19's `res.partner` doesn't support the `mobile` field
  - `server/odoo.ts` has `UNSUPPORTED_PARTNER_FIELDS` that auto-filters these
- Customers = Companies (`is_company: true`)
- Contacts = Child partners linked via `parent_id`

### 2. Email as Universal ID
All systems use normalized email for cross-platform matching:
```typescript
normalizeEmail("John.Doe@GMAIL.COM") → "johndoe@gmail.com"
```

### 3. SPOTLIGHT Coaching System
Generates daily prioritized tasks for sales reps using a bucket-based system:

**Task Buckets (with difficulty levels):**
- `calls` (hard) - Phone calls to customers and hot leads
- `follow_ups` (medium) - Scheduled follow-ups, lead nurturing
- `outreach` (medium) - Initial contact with new leads and dormant customers
- `data_hygiene` (easy) - Missing data, bounced emails
- `enablement` (easy) - Swatchbooks, samples, price lists

**Lead Integration:**
Leads are fully integrated into SPOTLIGHT for consistent daily work:
- **Calls bucket**: Hot/urgent leads (high priority) surface first for immediate calls
- **Outreach bucket**: New leads without first contact appear for initial outreach
- **Follow-ups bucket**: Leads that were contacted but haven't replied, qualified leads needing attention, or nurturing leads going stale

Lead task outcomes automatically update lead records:
- `email_sent` / `called` → Updates stage to 'contacted', sets lastContactAt
- `qualified` → Updates stage to 'qualified'
- `not_interested` / `lost` → Updates stage to 'lost' with reason
- Unassigned leads are auto-assigned to the rep who works them

**Cross-User Contact Prevention:**
- When ANY user contacts a customer/lead TODAY (email, call, quote), that customer/lead is automatically excluded from ALL other users' task lists for the rest of the day
- Prevents duplicate outreach that could irritate customers
- Uses both `spotlight_events` (completed tasks) and `customerActivityEvents` to detect contacts
- Applies to ALL task buckets (calls, follow-ups, outreach, data hygiene, enablement)

**Territory Skip Tracking:**
- When a rep marks "Not My Territory", it's tracked per customer
- If ALL active users skip the same customer, it's flagged for admin review
- Admin can view flagged customers in Settings > Territory tab
- Admin can decide to keep, delete, or reassign these customers

**Bounced Email Detection:**
- Scans Gmail for bounce notifications (mailer-daemon, postmaster, Mail Delivery Subsystem)
- Parses bounce messages to extract failed email addresses and bounce reasons
- Matches bounced emails to customers, contacts, OR leads in the database
- Stores detected bounces in `bounced_emails` table with status tracking
- Creates highest-priority hygiene task when a bounce is detected
- User options:
  - **Mark as Do Not Contact** (recommended) - Stops outreach, keeps record for reference
  - **Delete This Record** - Permanently removes the customer/lead from the system
  - **Keep Active** - If you believe the bounce was temporary
  - **Investigate Later** - Snooze for 7 days (uses `investigateUntil` timestamp to resurface correctly)
- Helps identify contacts who left the company or businesses that closed
- `server/bounce-detector.ts` handles Gmail scanning and parsing

**Remind Me Again Today:**
- Button in "What Happened" section allows reps to defer a task to later
- Task is temporarily skipped but tracked in session.remindTodayTasks
- Persisted in `spotlight_events` with event_type = 'remind_today' for cross-restart durability
- **Later Today Scratch Pad**: Floating amber button in bottom-right corner shows count of deferred tasks
  - Expands to show list of deferred tasks with company/lead names
  - Click task to navigate to that bucket (uses forceBucket to switch)
  - API endpoint: `GET /api/spotlight/remind-today` returns enriched task list with display names

**Session State Persistence:**
- Progress bars and session state survive server restarts/republishing
- Bucket completions stored in `spotlight_session_state` table
- Automatically restored when session is created for a user/date
- Includes: bucket completed counts, combo count, energy level, gamification state

**DRIP Email Integration:**
SPOTLIGHT automatically surfaces drip campaign follow-ups:
- **drip_reply_urgent** (calls bucket, priority 100): When a customer/lead replies to a drip email (Re: or Fwd: subject within 14 days of drip send), surfaces as HIGHEST priority task with "Call Now!" action
- **drip_stale_followup** (follow_ups bucket, priority 70): When 10+ days pass since last drip email with no reply, surfaces creative follow-up options:
  - Send Another Email
  - Send Swatch Book
  - Send Press Test Kit
  - Call Them
  - Connect on LinkedIn
  - Mark as Lost
- Both task types check `spotlight_events` to prevent re-surfacing handled tasks
- **Lead Support**: Drip campaigns now support both customers AND leads. The `dripCampaignAssignments` table has both `customerId` (for customers) and `leadId` (for leads) columns.
- Detection uses stricter matching to avoid false positives (subject line matching, time windows)

**Differentiated Task Cards:**
Tasks display with source-specific styling to help reps mentally switch contexts:
- **Email tasks** (pricing_samples_followup, unreplied_email): White card with red left border, Gmail icon, "Open in Gmail" button linking directly to the message, "Remind Later" button
- **Drip reply tasks** (drip_reply_urgent): Amber/orange pulsing gradient with flame icon and "Call Now!" badge
- **Drip stale tasks** (drip_stale_followup): Purple/indigo gradient with clock icon for creative follow-up prompts
- **Lead tasks**: Emerald/teal gradient with stage badges and priority indicators
- **Default tasks**: Blue gradient for standard tasks

The "Remind Me Later" feature allows reps to postpone email follow-ups by 1-30 days, creating a scheduled follow-up task.

### 4. UI Design Pattern ("Pastel & Soft")
- Cream background: `#FDFBF7`
- Glassmorphism cards with soft shadows
- Muted purple accents for actions
- Designed for professionals 30-50 to reduce eye strain

### 5. Data Flow Architecture
```
Frontend (React + TanStack Query)
    ↓ API calls
Backend (Express routes.ts)
    ↓ Storage interface
PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM)
    ↕ External APIs
Odoo V19 | Gmail | Shopify
```

## Database

### Migrations
```bash
npm run db:push          # Push schema changes
npm run db:push --force  # Force push if normal fails
```

### Key Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `customers` | Local CRM data (synced with Odoo) |
| `leads` | Sales leads with trust-building stages |
| `quotes` | Generated quotes |
| `productPricingMaster` | Unified product/pricing data |
| `spotlightTasks` | Daily coaching tasks |
| `spotlightEvents` | Task completion/skip tracking |
| `territorySkipFlags` | Customers flagged when all reps skip as "not my territory" |
| `bouncedEmails` | Detected bounced emails with resolution tracking |
| `customerJourneys` | Journey definitions |
| `emailThreads` | Gmail sync data |

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create file in `client/src/pages/`
2. Add route in `client/src/App.tsx`
3. Add sidebar link in `client/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`

### Adding an API Endpoint
1. Add route in `server/routes.ts`
2. Add storage method in `server/storage.ts` if needed
3. Update types in `shared/schema.ts` if new data

### Fixing Odoo Integration Issues
1. Check `UNSUPPORTED_PARTNER_FIELDS` in `server/odoo.ts`
2. Verify field names match Odoo V19 schema
3. Test with small data set first
