## Recent Changes

- **Adaptive Login Animation System (2025-07-16)**: Implemented intelligent login animation system that adapts to user experience level. New users (≤10 logins) get full 7-second welcome animation with login count indicator and snail icon. Experienced users (10-100 logins) get faster 60% speed animation. Expert users (100+ logins) skip animation entirely and go straight to dashboard. Added sarcastic "welcome back" animation with orange styling and clock icon for users returning after 30+ minutes of inactivity. Motivational quotes now show once per login session and auto-hide after 5 seconds. Created EmailCelebrationAnimation component for quote sending success feedback
- **User Activity Tracking (2025-07-16)**: Added loginCount and lastLoginDate fields to user schema with automatic incrementation on each login. Implemented activity tracking with localStorage to detect user inactivity periods for personalized return experience. Updated authentication system to track user engagement patterns for adaptive UX optimization
- **Price List Column Structure Update (2025-07-16)**: Updated Price List app with proper three-column pricing structure: (1) Price/Sq.M shows original CSV pricing data, (2) Price/Sheet shows actual price per individual sheet (sq.m price × square meters), (3) Price Per Pack shows price per sheet × minimum order quantity with 99-cent rounding applied only to retail pricing tier
- **Retail Pricing Rounding (2025-07-16)**: Implemented 99-cent rounding for retail pricing tiers across Quote Calculator and Price List apps. When "Retail" tier is selected, prices are automatically rounded to .99 cents (e.g., 17.89 becomes 17.99, 16.40 becomes 16.99). Applied to all price displays including web interface, PDF exports, and CSV downloads for consistent pricing presentation
- **Shipping Calculator App (2025-07-16)**: Built comprehensive shipping calculator app inspired by SpeedShip functionality. Features include package dimension and weight input, automatic dimensional weight calculation, zone-based pricing, multiple service levels (Ground, Priority, Express, Overnight), surcharge calculations for high-value packages, calculation history with CSV export, and responsive design. Added to dashboard with truck icon and integrated into main navigation. App starts fresh each time user visits (no data persistence) but maintains session history for current use and CSV export functionality
- **Icon and Font Enhancement (2025-07-16)**: Updated all CSV export buttons across entire application to use Sheet icon instead of Download icon for better user experience. Fixed Quote Calculator product dropdown to properly apply brand-specific fonts to category and type selection lists.
