## Recent Changes

- **Font Configuration Migration to Tailwind (2025-07-23)**: Migrated brand-specific font configurations from custom CSS to Tailwind utility classes in tailwind.config.ts. Added fontFamily extensions for font-graffiti (Lobster), font-solvit (Inter 700), font-cliq (Franklin Gothic), font-ele/font-eie (Roboto), font-rang (Inter 400), and additional variants (font-polyester, font-paper, font-blended, font-poly, font-stick). Removed custom .font-* CSS classes from index.css, enabling cleaner Tailwind-based font application throughout the application with consistent utility class naming. Added font preloading in index.html for critical fonts (Lobster, Inter, Roboto, Franklin Gothic) to improve perceived load performance with proper fallbacks for non-JS browsers. Note: .replit file configuration clarification needed for local vs deployment commands
- **Package.json Cross-Platform Compatibility (2025-07-23)**: Identified potential cross-platform environment variable issue with NODE_ENV=production syntax in start script. Installed cross-env package for Windows/deployment compatibility. Build process verified working correctly: Vite builds frontend to dist/public/, esbuild bundles server to dist/index.js. Confirmed output path verification: esbuild --outdir=dist produces dist/index.js (not dist/server/index.js), so start script path "node dist/index.js" is correct. Only environment variable syntax needs updating to use cross-env for production deployment compatibility
- **Saved Quotes CSV Export & Enhanced UI (2025-07-23)**: Complete upgrade to saved-quotes.tsx with comprehensive export functionality: (1) Added "Download All CSV" button for bulk export of all quotes with detailed metadata and flattened quote items, (2) Implemented search/filter toolbar for finding quotes by customer name, quote number, email, or status, (3) Added CSV/PDF re-download buttons for individual quotes with proper file generation, (4) Status-based badge coloring (sent=green, pending=yellow, failed=red), (5) Created detailed quote view modal showing full quote items JSON with formatting, (6) Enhanced table layout with action buttons (view, PDF download, CSV download, delete), (7) Added quote count badge and contextual empty states. Uses file-saver library for reliable CSV downloads with timestamped filenames and comprehensive quote data including parsed items summary
- **Saved Quotes Component Comprehensive Fixes (2025-07-23)**: Fixed all critical issues in saved-quotes.tsx including: (1) Added missing queryFn to useQuery with proper API request handling, (2) Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript error checking using instanceof Error, (3) Replaced window.confirm with professional Dialog component for delete confirmations, (4) Added safe date formatting function with fallback handling for invalid dates, (5) Fixed user role access with proper TypeScript casting, (6) Improved mutation error handling and loading states, (7) Added proper state management for delete dialog. Component now provides robust error handling, better UX, and maintains data integrity
- **Price List API Implementation & Bug Fixes (2025-07-23)**: Fixed all critical issues in price-list.tsx by implementing missing /api/generate-price-list-pdf and /api/generate-price-list-csv endpoints with proper HTML and CSV generation. Enhanced filtering to ensure product types match selected categories explicitly, added NaN protection for square meter calculations, implemented persistent quote number generation (prevents regeneration on every download), fixed unique keys for table rows, and improved category-type relationship filtering. Price list now properly handles size-specific pricing and maintains data integrity throughout the download process
- **Size-Specific Pricing Support (2025-07-23)**: Enhanced product pricing table with size_id foreign key to support size-specific pricing overrides (e.g., 8.5x11" vs 12x18" of same product type can have different prices). Added optional sizeId parameter to pricing API endpoints and updated quote calculator to pass size information when fetching prices. System now checks for size-specific pricing first, then falls back to type-level pricing for maximum flexibility
- **Database Schema Optimization: Timestamp & Integer Fields (2025-07-23)**: Fixed critical database schema issues by converting min_order_qty from VARCHAR(50) to INTEGER with default value of 50, and sent_quotes.created_at from VARCHAR(50) to TIMESTAMP with DEFAULT NOW(). This prevents runtime parsing errors, enables proper date sorting/querying, and improves data integrity. Updated all application code to work with proper data types instead of string parsing. Schema now properly handles timestamps and minimum order quantities with appropriate defaults
- **Blob-Based PDF Download Implementation (2025-07-23)**: Replaced print window approach with blob-based download method for true file saving functionality. Updated PDF generation to use `Blob` API with proper file download using temporary anchor elements. Users now get actual file downloads instead of print dialogs, improving user experience and ensuring quotes are properly saved to disk with correct filenames
- **Enhanced Quote Number Generation System (2025-07-23)**: Implemented robust quote number generation with backend uniqueness validation and customer identifier prefix support. Created server-side generateUniqueQuoteNumber function with retry logic, database validation against sentQuotes table, and fallback mechanisms. Added customer prefix extraction (first 3 letters of company name) for shared quotes with format 4SG-CUS-YYMMDD-XXXX. Includes useQuoteNumber hook for frontend integration, format validation, and utility functions for parsing quote numbers. System ensures uniqueness across all quotes with comprehensive error handling and automatic retries
- **Performance Optimization with Debouncing (2025-07-23)**: Implemented comprehensive debounce system across all search and filter inputs to reduce re-renders and improve UX. Added custom useDebounce hook with 300ms delay for search fields and variable delays for different input types. Applied to SearchableCustomerSelect, Customer Management search/filters, Price Management search, and other key components. This significantly reduces API calls during typing and improves application responsiveness
- **Critical SelectItem Bug Fix (2025-07-23)**: Fixed deployed application crash caused by SelectItem components with empty string values in Customer Management filters. Replaced empty string values with meaningful defaults ("all-cities", "all-provinces", "all-emails") and updated filtering logic to handle these new values properly. Application now deploys successfully without React Select errors
- **File Upload Tracking System (2025-07-22)**: Implemented comprehensive file tracking for CSV uploads in Product Management system. Added database table for file upload metadata including filename, upload timestamp, processing statistics, and active file status. Enhanced Product Management interface to display current data source information with file name, upload date, and processing statistics (records added/updated). System now tracks which CSV file is currently active across all applications (Quote Calculator, Price List, Product Management) and provides visual confirmation to users about data source. Includes automatic data refresh after uploads and proper cache invalidation for real-time updates
- **Critical Bug Fixes & Security Enhancements (2025-07-22)**: Fixed major application stability issues including: (1) Enhanced CSV size parsing regex patterns to handle double quotes (54""x100') and corrupted CSV data with appended text, (2) Improved error handling middleware to prevent server crashes by removing dangerous throw statements after responses, (3) Added comprehensive numeric field validation for competitor pricing to prevent NaN values in database, (4) Strengthened authentication bypasses to be more secure in production environments, (5) Enhanced input validation and sanitization across all API endpoints, (6) Removed pricing tier columns (EXPORT, MASTER_DISTRIBUTOR, etc.) from Product Management app - these are now only visible in Pricing Database for cleaner product catalog view, (7) Fixed CSV category name duplication where ProductType containing redundant category names caused doubled-up display. System now properly cleans type names by removing category prefixes (e.g., "Graffiti Polyester Paper 5mil" becomes "5mil"). These fixes eliminate console warnings, prevent potential server crashes, and ensure data integrity throughout the application
- **Universal CSV Data Append Logic Fix (2025-07-21)**: Enhanced CSV upload merge logic to handle all product categories (GraffitiStick, Solvit, CLiQ, MXP, etc.) with two merge strategies: (1) Update existing products with matching ProductIDs by filling empty fields and updating changed values, (2) Match and update products with empty ProductIDs by comparing ProductName, ProductType, and Size patterns.
