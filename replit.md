## Key Concepts for New Developers

### 1. Odoo V19 Integration
- Syncs customers, products, pricelists, and orders
- **Important**: Odoo V19's `res.partner` doesn't support the `mobile` field
  - `server/odoo.ts` has `UNSUPPORTED_PARTNER_FIELDS` that auto-filters these
- Customers = Companies (`is_company: true`)
- Contacts = Child partners linked via `parent_id`

### 2. Email as Universal ID
All systems use normalized email for cross-platform matching:
```typescript
normalizeEmail("John.Doe@GMAIL.COM") → "johndoe@gmail.com"
```

### 3. SPOTLIGHT Coaching System
Generates daily prioritized tasks for sales reps using a bucket-based system:

**Task Buckets (with difficulty levels):**
- `calls` (hard) - Phone calls to customers and hot leads
- `follow_ups` (medium) - Scheduled follow-ups, lead nurturing
- `outreach` (medium) - Initial contact with new leads and dormant customers
- `data_hygiene` (easy) - Missing data, bounced emails
- `enablement` (easy) - Swatchbooks, samples, price lists

**Lead Integration:**
Leads are fully integrated into SPOTLIGHT for consistent daily work:
- **Calls bucket**: Hot/urgent leads (high priority) surface first for immediate calls
- **Outreach bucket**: New leads without first contact appear for initial outreach
- **Follow-ups bucket**: Leads that were contacted but haven't replied, qualified leads needing attention, or nurturing leads going stale

Lead task outcomes automatically update lead records:
- `email_sent` / `called` → Updates stage to 'contacted', sets lastContactAt
- `qualified` → Updates stage to 'qualified'
- `not_interested` / `lost` → Updates stage to 'lost' with reason
- Unassigned leads are auto-assigned to the rep who works them

**Territory Skip Tracking:**
- When a rep marks "Not My Territory", it's tracked per customer
- If ALL active users skip the same customer, it's flagged for admin review
- Admin can view flagged customers in Settings > Territory tab
- Admin can decide to keep, delete, or reassign these customers

**Bounced Email Detection:**
- Scans Gmail for bounce notifications (mailer-daemon, postmaster, delivery failure messages)
- Extracts bounced email addresses and matches them to customers/contacts
- Creates highest-priority hygiene task when a bounce is detected
- User options: Mark as Do Not Contact (recommended), Keep Active, or Investigate Later
- Helps identify contacts who left the company or businesses that closed

### 4. UI Design Pattern ("Pastel & Soft")
- Cream background: `#FDFBF7`
- Glassmorphism cards with soft shadows
- Muted purple accents for actions
- Designed for professionals 30-50 to reduce eye strain

### 5. Data Flow Architecture
```
Frontend (React + TanStack Query)
    ↓ API calls
Backend (Express routes.ts)
    ↓ Storage interface
PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM)
    ↕ External APIs
Odoo V19 | Gmail | Shopify
```

## Database

### Migrations
```bash
npm run db:push          # Push schema changes
npm run db:push --force  # Force push if normal fails
```

### Key Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `customers` | Local CRM data (synced with Odoo) |
| `leads` | Sales leads with trust-building stages |
| `quotes` | Generated quotes |
| `productPricingMaster` | Unified product/pricing data |
| `spotlightTasks` | Daily coaching tasks |
| `spotlightEvents` | Task completion/skip tracking |
| `territorySkipFlags` | Customers flagged when all reps skip as "not my territory" |
| `customerJourneys` | Journey definitions |
| `emailThreads` | Gmail sync data |

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create file in `client/src/pages/`
2. Add route in `client/src/App.tsx`
3. Add sidebar link in `client/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`

### Adding an API Endpoint
1. Add route in `server/routes.ts`
2. Add storage method in `server/storage.ts` if needed
3. Update types in `shared/schema.ts` if new data

### Fixing Odoo Integration Issues
1. Check `UNSUPPORTED_PARTNER_FIELDS` in `server/odoo.ts`
2. Verify field names match Odoo V19 schema
3. Test with small data set first

- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Avoid**: Technical jargon in user-facing text
- **UI priority**: Clean, professional, low eye-strain
